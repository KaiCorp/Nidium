Compliation of Nidium on windows
================================

There are some dependencies needed to get nidium compiling on windows.
Here are some steps, we are documentating things as we move along.

We will be compiling ONLY with MSVC on the windows platform.
We won't use clang, cygwin or mingw! 
We have put a lot of efford to create some 'configure_*' scripts that are using the command line tools of visualstudio, not the gui.
You can use the gui for your convieniance, but you'll get the same error messages and warnings when you compile it in a terminal.

We are focussing on windows 64 bit OS, but 32 bit should work as well.
We are focussing on MSVC 2015, but 2013 should work as well.

(BTW: That this port was started on the branch with the name 'windows-x86' does not have any significant meaning.

# 64x Windows Host

Do you have a windows machine? Probably not, but you can test one for 90 days.

* Download and install virtualbox
* Download and install one of the 64 bit images from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/
* Unpack the download, you might want to copy and rename it
* Start the virtual box
* Import the appliance, and configure it as you like.
  (e.g. 4 processors, 4G, 10 mb video for fullscreen, 25G disk)
* Start it up
* Do your thing: disable defragmentation for ssd, set the clock, antivirus, firewall, windows updates, users&passwords, networkconfig, keyboard settings, ..

# Rights

The 'konstruktor.py' build tools does a lot of symlink juggling. By default, (ntfs?) needs more rights.

* Start 'secpol.msc' as administrator
* 'Local Policies' > 'User Rights Assignement' > 'Create symbolic links'
   add your user to the groups...
* Start 'gpupdate /force'
* Log in as your user

If you are running into user rights issue when creating symlink it could be because you are running the configure scripts with an Administrator account. In this case, go to 'Local Policies' > 'Security options' and disable `User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode` (but please not this is not recommended, you should create a non administrator account for building nidium)

# Software

## Microsoft Visual Studio Community edition 2015

The community edition is free and has all the stuff that we need.

* Download from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48146
* Run
  - choose custom;
  - select 'Visual Studio 2015 Update 3'
  - select 'Programming Languages|Visual C++|Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015
  - select 'Visual C++
  - unselect 'Windows and Web Development|Universal Windows App Development Tools|Windows 10 SDK (10.0.10240)"
  - select 'Windows and Web Development|Universal Windows App Development Tools|Windows 10 SDK (10.0.10586)"
  - unselect 'Microsoft Web Developer Tools'
  - next, the installation takes longer then a coffe break, so you could continue with the steps below.

When the installation is done, you can take another coffeebreak to start Visual Studio for the first time, but it is not needed: Our intention is that you can hack on nidium with just your favorite editor and the configure_* scripts.

## Directx

Nidium use DirectX (trough ANGLE) to display hardware accelerated graphics. Make sure your computer has DirectX installed ( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx )

## Windows 10 SDK

This is needed by ANGLE to get d3d11 DLLs.

* Download from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk

You'll need to add Windows 10 SDK bin directory to your path as some of our third-party needs `rc.exe` which is not in standard path :
```
set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.15063.0/x64/;%PATH%
```

## Mozilla build

To build spidermonkey we well reuse parts of the mozilla buildprocess, this has a lot of unixy tools, including bash, sed, awk, sort, grep, find, vim, which etc

* Download from https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild
* Run and install it in 'c:\mozilla-build'. I don't like to place stuff in the root, but it appears to be an essential place.
* Standard this comes with python 2.7.11 Which has a problem with urllib and https. And konstructor.py needs that.
* Move the directory c:\mozilla-build\python to c:\mozilla-build\python-2.7.11 (or remove it)

## git

Obviously,

* Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
* Install, add git to your path
* You might want to set your information

 Please note that mozilla's binutils does not include 'pr' nor 'seq'. We need this to build ffmpeg.
```
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

And to keep our commit history a little cleaner, we would appreciate something like this:

```
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

ymmv, but there is kdiff3 in the mozilla-build directory

```
git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
git config --global mergetool.kdiff3.path "c:/mozilla-build/kdiff3/kdiff3.exe"
git config --global --add mergetool.kdiff3.trustExitCode false

git config --global --add diff.guitool kdiff3
git config --global --add difftool.kdiff3.path "c:/mozilla-build/kdiff3/kdiff3.exe"
git config --global --add difftool.kdiff3.trustExitCode false
```

# python

The konstruktor.py script is written in python.

* Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/
  you can pick any version as long as it is higher the 2.7.11 and lower then 2.8 
* Install this in 'c:\mozilla-build\python'
* Install for "Current user only" otherwise you'll run into issues when installing pywin32 later
* It is wise to update pip

```
c:\mozilla-build\python\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

* Install the stuff that was originally in the mozilla-build/python-2.7.11

```
c:\mozilla-build\python\python.exe -m pip install hgwatchman
```

We will ignore the error now; we don't need hgwatchman any way.

```
c:\mozilla-build\python\python.exe -m pip install mercurial
```

We probably don't need mercurial.

```
c:\mozilla-build\python\python.exe -m pip install virtualenv
```
We might not need virtualenv, as mozilla-central provides an older version as well. 


# pywin32

The 'konstruktor.py' script does a lot of filesystem operations, pywin32 makes that possible.
 
* Download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/, sorry about that...
* Install and choose c:\mozilla-build\python 

## svn

Angle will start depot_tools to download svn.
For some reason that fails, let's install it manually.
* Download from https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra/svn_bin.zip.
* Install and put it in your path

```
cd c:\Data\ProgramFiles\
c:\mozilla-build\7zip\7z.exe x c:\Data\Downloads\svn_bin.zip
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Data\ProgramFiles\svn_bin
// If you are using powershell
$env:Path +=";c:\Users\efyx\Desktop\svn_bin\"
```

# cmake

* Download from https://cmake.org/download/
* Install

# Perl
OpenSSL require Perl 5.10+, install StrawberryPerl from http://strawberryperl.com/ and add it to your path :
```
set PATH=C:\Strawberry\perl\bin\;%PATH%
```

## Finetune your shell experience

```
ln -s /c/Windows/system32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell /bin/powershell
```

Set up the path (with mozilla's msys before git's)

~/.bashrc

```
export PYTHONPATH=/c/Data/nidium/NidiumTools/src
export VIRTUALENV_PYTHON=/c/mozilla-build/python/python.exe
export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ files/Git/bin:/c/Data/ProgramFiles/svn_bin:/c/Program\ Files/Cmake/bin:/c/Data/ProgramFiles/binutils/bin:/c/Program\ Files/Git/usr/bin
cd /c/Data/nidium/Nidium
```

~.bash_profile

```
# generated by Git for Windows
test -f ~/.profile && . ~/.profile
test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
```

## Optional, but productivity is king

### watchman

Facebook's watchman is not as intuitive as 'entrproject.org', but it is allready included in mozilla-build. So we can reuse it with something like:

```
/c/mozilla-build/watchman/watchman.exe watch src gyp patch
/c/mozilla-build/watchman/watchman.exe -- trigger compile_nidium src gyp patch -- ./configure_libnidiumcore
```

### console

In most cases cmd.exe will suffice, copy and paste that works, there is mintty.exe in both "c:\mozilla-builds\msys\mintty.exe" and c:\Program Files\Git\mingw32\bin
If you want multiple tabs etc checkout https://www.fosshub.com/ConEmu.html.

```
mkdir c:\Data\ProgramFiles\ConEmuPack
cd c:\Data\ProgramFiles\ConEmuPack
c:\mozilla-build\7zip\7z.exe x c:\Data\Downloads\ConEmuPack.161206.7z
```

### Tiling window managers

ymmv on this, but since we have a git and visual studio, there are only a few
steps needed:

```
cd c:\data\
git clone https://github.com/ZaneA/HashTWM.git
"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat"
MSBuild.exe HashTWM\vsproj\HashTWM.sln /p:PlatformToolset=v140
```

start it with `c:\Data\HashTWM\bin\hashtwm.exe`

### gvim

ymmv obviously, but there are emacs and vim' s in c:\mozilla-build\

* download from http://www.vim.org/download.php/#pc

If you are a vim user but want to work inside Visual Studio's gui, you can install vsvim by clicking:
Tools - Extensions and Updates - online - Visual studio Gallery -  CTRL+E - vsvim - Download - Install - Restart now.

### clover 

Tab browsing in file explorer

* Download from http://ejie.me/download/
* Install, guessing the buttons is a bit scary

# Checkout of nidium

## Cloning nidium from github

### Basic checkout

```
mkdir c:\Data\nidium
cd c:\Data\nidium
git clone https://github.com/nidium/NidiumTools.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nidium/Nidium.git

```
## Set up the paths

Mozilla has a nice script to prepare the environment with all the mvsc bells and wistles.

Depending of your msvc (2013/2013) and platform (32/x64) you start one of the scripts.

```
#c:\mozilla-build\start-shell-msvc2013.bat
#c:\mozilla-build\start-shell-msvc2015.bat
#c:\mozilla-build\start-shell-msvc2013-x64.bat
 c:\mozilla-build\start-shell-msvc2015-x64.bat
```

A 'bash' shell opens and you are in your 'home' directory.

> Please note: if you are using msvc 2013, then you need to tweak one line in 'src/libapenetwork/configure':

```
    Variables.set("msvs_version", 2013)
```

## Create some missing symlinks

```
ln -s /c/mozilla-build/python/python.exe /usr/bin/python2.7
```

# Compiling of nidium

## For 'now'

While we are still working on the windows port, things are a bit different...

```
cd NidiumTools
set PYTHONPATH=%cd%\src
git fetch origin windows-x86
git checkout windows-x86
cd ..\Nidium
git fetch origin windows-x86
git checkout windows-x86
cd src\libapenetwork
git fetch origin windows-x86
git checkout windows-x86
cd ..\..
./configure_server 
# currently: it compiles and links with 616 warnings
# workaround: copy some icu and nspr .dll's next to nidium's executable files.
ind third-party/mozilla-central/js/src/obj/dist/bin third-party/mozilla-central/nsprpu b/dist/lib -name '*.dll' -exec cp {} ./bin \;0
./configure_server --unit-tests --auto-tests --asume-yes
```

## For 'in the near future'

```
./configure_frontend --ignore-build=basekit,libcoroutine,skia,angle
./configure_frontend --unit-tests --auto-tests --asume-yes
```

At this point there will be .. complilation errors,

# For 'in the far future'

```
./configure_frontend
```

## For 'In the far future, in a galaxy far away'

```
cd Nidium
./configure_frontend
```

# Running nidium

```
./bin/nidium
```
